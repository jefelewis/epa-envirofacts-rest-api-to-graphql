## About Operation Refactor America
Operation Refactor America is a not associated with any government agency, but our goal is to empower citizens with transparent data. Only a fraction of government agencies provide public APIs, which are usually poorly documented, built on archaic REST architecture, and contains scattered data. Our mission is to retrieve that valuable data and convert them into an intuitive and modern API using GraphQL Server.

## About the Data
The data comes directly from the Environmental Protection Agency's REST API (Envirofacts). The REST endpoints have been mapped as GraphQL types and resolvers. A summary of endpoints and documentation can be found here: https://www3.epa.gov/enviro/

## GraphQL Server: Apollo Server
